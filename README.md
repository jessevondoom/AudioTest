#AudioTest

Tiny script to test HTML5 audio with true success/failure rather than the native 
Audio objects yes/no/maybe approach. 

**Requires:** MooTools. Was part of a larger project that needed it, so I used 
Moo Class conventions. Will rework without need of a library. 

BSD licnse, quickie test, use however you like at your own risk.
